Publish directly from Google Picasa desktop into WordPress media and optionally create a post entry displaying the uploaded images using the Wordpress `[gallery]` tag.

== Description ==

Provides a button to be installed into the Google Picasa desktop to directly upload files from Picasa as WordPress media.  Once the button has been downloaded and installed in Picasa, images can be selected in Picasa and uploaded to your WordPress blog with a simple click of the button within Picasa.

If you are not logged in to your blog, you will first be directed to the login page and then return to the upload screen to select the upload options.

This plugin is based on the initial works by [clyang](http://clyang.net/blog/2009/02/06/128 "Picasa2Wordpress Blog Article") and the examples from Google for the [Picasa Button API](http://code.google.com/apis/picasa/docs/button_api.html "Picasa Button API") and [Picasa Web Uploader API](http://code.google.com/apis/picasa/docs/web_uploader.html "Picasa Web Uploader API").

This is a real plugin that lives in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory and does not require special files to be placed in either your server root or in the `wp-admin/` directory.


*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.
